# ImportExportConfig

## Introduction

This repo contains a collection of scripts for importing & exporting configuration files to be used when re-installing Linux.

The scripts were written with Fedora in mind but most can be used on all distros.

Scripts only working on one specific distro have the name of the distro in the file.
